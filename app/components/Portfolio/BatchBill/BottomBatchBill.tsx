      Batchbills intends to simplify the process of paying bills ranging from airtime, data, electricity, cable tv and other bills that can be paid currently in Nigeria in the interim.<br/><br/>

In itâ€™s next release, Batchbills will be looking into expanding into paying bills that are available in other countries outside of Nigeria as well.<br/><br/>

I collaborated with Batchbill team to design an on-demand payment service web application.
