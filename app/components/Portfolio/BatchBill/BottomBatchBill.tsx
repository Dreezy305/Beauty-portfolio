        Brand Overview
      </h5>

      <p className="font-LotaRegular font-normal text-xl leading-8 py-7">
        Batchbills intends to simplify the process of paying bills ranging from
        airtime, data, electricity, cable tv and other bills that can be paid
        currently in Nigeria in the interim.
        <br />
        <br />
        In itâ€™s next release, Batchbills will be looking into expanding into
        paying bills that are available in other countries outside of Nigeria as
        well.
        <br />
        <br />I collaborated with Batchbill team to design an on-demand payment
        service web application.
